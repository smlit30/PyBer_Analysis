# MODULE 5 - PyBer Analysis with MatPlotLib

# OVERVIEW 

The purpose of this analyssi was to breakdown and see the ride information from varous cities that were either Urban, Suburban or Rural city type.  We used Pyber ride-sharing information to perform our analysis and deliver a useful breakdown to the decision-makers at PyBer.  The paragraphs below will discuss the results of the analysis that has a breakdown of fares by the city type and how those fares change overtime.   

# RESULTS

First lets take a look at the table below that shows the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver in each of the city types from our ride-share information.  

Table Breakdown: 

	    Total Rides	    Total Drivers	    Total Fares	    Average Fare per Ride	    Average Fare per Driver

Rural	    125	            78	            $4,327.93	        $34.62	                        $55.49

Suburban	625	            490	            $19,356.33	        $30.97	                        $39.50

Urban	    1,625	        2,405	        $39,854.38	        $24.53	                        $16.57


A few data points stick out here.  First the total fares in the urban cities are nealy 10x of that in the Rural cities while the number of drivers is Urban cities is 30x of that in Rural cities.   It makes sense that there would be more rides in Urban areas as well as more drivers so to get a different comparison it is useful to note the average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  The average fare per ride and average fare per driver is highest in the Rural areas.  This may relationship may have somethign to do with the fact ther are more drivers than total rides in the Urban areas and drive prices down due to compeitition in drivers for that area.  Both Suburban and Rural areas have more total rides than drivers.  The total fares by week as shown in the graph "Pyber Fare Summary" shows the total fare by week changing up and down throughout the year.  This is to be expected as different times of the year would have less trips and certain areas could have more events going on and thus increase total rides in different city tyes.  More analysis would need to be done to make further decisions on why this would change throughout the year. 


# SUMMARY

Three reccomendations for Pyber: 
One - Market heavier to increase number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas to try and bring average fare per driver down. 
Two - Average Fare per driver being higher in Suburban and Rural areas could indicate longer rides (further analysis would need to be done to confirm) and adjusting the cost/mile of a trip could help bring down avareage fare.  
Three - Limit number of drivers allowed in Urban areas so that the competition to get rides is driven down.
